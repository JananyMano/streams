## Architecture

The app contains three mains folders: api, client and rtmpserver.

We are using the api folder to store data, in this case, data about streams.

The client folder contains all our React App components.

The rtmpserver folder contains [Node-Media-Server](https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server
) configuration.
